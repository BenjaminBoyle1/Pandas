# Overview

As a software engineer striving to enhance my skills, I embarked on a project to delve into machine learning and data analysis. For this project, I utilized a dataset obtained from Kaggle, comprising student performance records in various subjects, alongside demographic details such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation course completion status. My objective was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting student performance based on these factors, thereby gaining insights into the underlying relationships between demographic attributes and academic outcomes.

# Data Analysis Results

**Questions and Answers:**
1. How does parental level of education affect student performance?
   - Analysis revealed that students with parents holding higher education degrees tended to achieve higher scores in math, reading, and writing compared to those with parents having lower educational attainment.

2. Is there a significant difference in performance between students who completed the test preparation course and those who did not?
   - Students who completed the test preparation course generally exhibited higher average scores in math, reading, and writing compared to their counterparts who did not complete the course. Statistical tests confirmed a significant difference in performance between the two groups.

# Development Environment

For this project, I utilized Python as the primary programming language along with the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data manipulation and preprocessing
- Scikit-learn: for implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization

# Future Work

In future iterations of this project, I aim to:
* Explore more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to improve predictive performance.
* Conduct feature engineering to derive new meaningful features from the existing dataset.
* Implement hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the model's performance.
* Evaluate the model's robustness on unseen data through cross-validation techniques.
